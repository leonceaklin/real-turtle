# Real Turtle
[![Build](https://github.com/leonceaklin/real-turtle/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/leonceaklin/real-turtle/actions/workflows/main.yml)

A simple yet powerful turtle graphics library for JavaScript. It aims to make turtle graphics in JavaScript as simple as possible while giving insights to HTML canvas by staying close to its spec

[Try it outðŸš€](https://repl.it/@leonceaklin/RealTurtleSimpleTemplate)

[Try it out (async mode)ðŸš€](https://repl.it/@leonceaklin/RealTurtleAsyncTemplate)

## Getting started

### Via CLI

Install it via NPM

```sh
npm i real-turtle
```

Import the class in your JS file

```javascript
import RealTurtle from 'real-turtle'
```

Create a RealTurtle Instance

```javascript
const turtle = new RealTurtle(element, options)
```

### Via CDN (in the browser)

#### General

Include a the script tag above your command code

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/real-turtle"></script>
```

```javascript
var turtle = new RealTurtle.default(element, options)
```

#### With a helper

If you are a JavaScript beginner who wants to get started quickly, a helper is recommended. It creates a RealTurtle instance with predefined options and makes it acessible through a global turtle variable. All you need to provide is an HTML-Element with the ID `#real-turtle`

> Note: The helper is only recommended for simple use cases such as playgrounds.

Include the helper script tag below your RealTurtle HTML element.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/real-turtle/dist/helpers/simple.js"></script>
```

##### Example using a helper

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/real-turtle"></script>
<canvas id="real-turtle"></canvas>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/real-turtle/build/helpers/simple.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">
//Your turtle commands go here
turtle.forward(100)
</script>
```

## Options

When creating a `new RealTurtle()` instance, you can pass an options object as the second parameter which may contain the following properties:

| Property    | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                | Default  |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `verbose`   | Boolean | Defines if the instance should log every step to the console.                                                                              | `false`  |
| `autoStart` | Boolean | Defines if the turtle should start drawing automatically. If enabled, the `.start()`Â command at the end of your commands becomes obsolete. | `false`  |
| `image`     | String  | Sets the URL of the sprite image of the turtle.                                                                                            | [String] |
| `state`     | Object  | Sets the initial state of the turtle. More shown below.                                                                                    | [Object] |
| `async`     | Boolean | Defines if you want to use the turtle in async mode                                                                                        | `false`  |

### Initial turtle state

In you options object, you can declare the initial State of your turtle via the `state` property. It may contain the folloing properties:

| Property      | Type                    | Description                                 | Default   |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `size`        | Number                  | The size of the turtle in px                | `15`      |
| `strokeStyle` | String/Gradient/Pattern | The style of the stroke drawn by the turtle | `"black"` |

This list is not completed yet

### Normal mode vs. async mode

Normally real-turtle gathers your commands and lists them in a task list before executing them. The commands you give the turtle are therefore not executed until everything is stored in the task list. This makes animations possible. However, this is not how JavaScript works and it means that forever loops such as `while(true)` are not possible that way.

With async mode, which can be enabled by using the async option when creating the instance or the async helper, you can solve this. You write your code into an async function and wait for the tasks to be executed using `await` .

#### Async example

```javascript
async function run(){
     //Your turtle commands go here
     await turtle.move(200)
     console.log("Done")
}
run()
```

## Commands

### `.start()` the most important command at the end of your script if you don't use async mode

The `.start()`command tells the turtle to actually start the drawing process.

Unless you are using `autoStart` or a helper, your turtle will only move if you add the `turtle.start()` command at the very end of your commands!

### Move around
